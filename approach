## ML,Dl and object detection and related approach and everything add here: 
1. https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijdmb/2018/4546896/  (faster rcnn and improved for small objects)
2. https://github.com/Aakash-kaushik/image_classification/blob/master/Scripts/scrape_modak.py
   -(https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md)
4. SuperResolution library: https://github.com/idealo/image-super-resolution
5. face detection (jis camera ne detect kiya sirf us camera ko he scan karenge jab user reqest dalega and can do a extensive serach agr unme bhi nahi milla toh)
6. because companies don't have a large dataset of a single employee (https://towardsdatascience.com/one-shot-learning-face-recognition-using-siamese-neural-network-a13dcf739e),
	(https://medium.com/intro-to-artificial-intelligence/one-shot-learning-explained-using-facenet-dff5ad52bd38)	
	6.1.We can implement it from scratch with fastai 
7. mmdetection chal gaya 
8. objects not in dataset, look google form responses(https://towardsdatascience.com/collecting-data-for-custom-object-detection-e7d888c1469b),(https://www.arunponnusamy.com/preparing-custom-dataset-for-training-yolo-object-detector.html)
WE FUCKING DON'T HAVE TIME TO ANNOTATE THE OBJECTS ONE BY ONE 

## for the user interaction part and server side part add here:
Server side for  - handling video feed @(gaurav)
		 - user interaction (when the user inputs something it should show the list of items matching to what the user has typed) @(satyam)
		 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT80XhYJdBw(user interaction )
		 - encryption(superficial - access for admin)
		 - data transfer for the request
		 - returning the result(only if necessary send a  frame of video /image) 
		 -Making login page with database(Gaurav)
		 https://youtu.be/OTmQOjsl0eg(link for login page)
		 -Front End-modify my Bootstrap page
		 
		 

## for the  overall ordered workflow of the application:
        0.keeping track of the person and recording the time-stamp
	1.search request from the user 
	2.server requesting the system for the video feed 
	3.priority-vise checking of the cameras where the person stayed longer (using face detection), terminate the serach if found else continue to the remaining cameras.
	4.if the object is found after all this keep a track on the object till the user takes it back 
	5.if not found do periodic scans till a period of time suppose for one day after each hour so like for 24 times in a day and then stop.
	??How to detect in night??
	
## Proposal for new things in the idea or improvment on the existing things: 

##URGENT
1. Need to train the model on things not included in dataset
  1.1 where to download the dataset from and how much images to download and what tool to use because the script mentioned in point 2 in ml,dl can just download 100 images by a single keyword so you have to type 10 word for 1000 images 
2. Web page(to test the working of things)
