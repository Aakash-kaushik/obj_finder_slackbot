## ML,Dl and object detection and related approach and everything add here 
1. https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijdmb/2018/4546896/  (faster rcnn and improved for small objects)
2. https://github.com/Aakash-kaushik/image_classification/blob/master/Scripts/scrape_modak.py
3. COCO pre-trained R-CNN (https://medium.com/object-detection-using-tensorflow-and-coco-pre/object-detection-using-tensorflow-and-coco-pre-trained-models-5d8386019a8)
   -(https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md)
4. SuperResolution library: https://github.com/idealo/image-super-resolution
5. face detection (jis camera ne detect kiya sirf us camera ko he scan karenge jab user reqest dalega and can do a extensive serach agr unme bhi nahi milla toh)
6. because companies don't have a large dataset of a single employee (https://towardsdatascience.com/one-shot-learning-face-recognition-using-siamese-neural-network-a13dcf739e)
7. mmdetection chal gaya 
8. objects not in dataset, look google form responses

## for the user interaction part and server side part add here
Server side for  - handling video feed
		 - user interaction (when the user inputs something it should show the list of items matching to what the user has typed) 
		 - encryption(superficial - access for admin)
		 - data transfer for the request

		 - returning the result(only if necessary send a  frame of video /image) 

## for the  overall ordered workflow of the application:
